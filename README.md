## Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop a bot using Reinforcement Learning that can play Connect 4 against humans.

## Motivation
Reinforcement learning has recently been at the forefront of machine learning and applied to a wide variety of situations ranging from playing classical video games and beating professionals in board games [1, 2] to improving elevator performance [3]. Though not within the scope of this class, we believe reinforcement learning to be a good topic to explore and learn about in addition to the classical machine learning methods covered in class.

## Training and Model Architecture
TBD
### Libraries and Tools
